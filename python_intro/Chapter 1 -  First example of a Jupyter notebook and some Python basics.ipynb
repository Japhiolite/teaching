    "## General structure\n",
    "<a id=\"1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start talking about what a notebook contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of the notebook you can see the **<font color=black>user interface</font>**. Here you find all options and actions that we will talk about in a second. This is also where you can *save, rename and restart your notebook* (more on that also later).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main body of the notebook is divided into different **<font color=black>cells</font>**. <br>\n",
    "If you are working with a cell there are two different modes: If the cell is surrounded by a green border, you are in **<font color=green>edit mode</font>**, meaning you will be able to write and change things within the cell. If the cell is bordered with a blue line, you are in **<font color=blue>command mode</font>**, which allows you to edit the notebook in whole. You can switch between the two modes by pressing <kbd>ENTER</kbd> and<kbd>ESC</kbd> or by clicking inside or next to the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "While edit mode is the mode you are normally working in when coding (as you have to write the code obviously), command mode allows you to do some operations with handy hotkeys instead of using the user interface. For example, you can press <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>b</kbd> to add a new cell above or below.\n",
    "The most important hotkey combination you need to remember though is <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to execute a cell (works in both modes). Executing a cell means running the code inside it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from cells that contain code there are also **markdown cells** containing text. So, this text you are just reading is in a markdown cell. When entering edit mode, you can see it in is original format. In the user interface you can select in a dropdown menu wether a cell should be code or markdown (and a couple of other options that are not too interesting for us now).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks we are providing will always be a mix of Markdown cell describing theory or tasks and code cells containing examples or space for you to code.    \n",
    "\n",
    "For some more exhaustive information on Jupyter notebooks check out the following cheat sheet:<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Use the following cell to play around around a little - switch between edit and command mode, run the cell with <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, make it a markdown cell, add anew cell below and above and delete thise cells again (hotkey for deleting a cell si pressing <kbd>d</kbd> twice in command mode).\n"
